r"""
Computes the GL₂(R) orbit closure of a surface.

Naturally, this will only find a lower bound for the orbit closure, i.e., the
space it finds might be too small because not enough directions have been
investigated that would lead us to the full space.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "orbit-closure", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker orbit-closure [OPTIONS]
      Determines the GL₂(R) orbit closure of ``surface``.
    Options:
      --limit INTEGER             stop after having looked at that many flow
                                  decompositions  [default: no limit]
      --stale-limit TEXT          expand the search radius after processing that
                                  many flow decompositions with cylinders without an
                                  increase in dimension; if not an integer, then
                                  this is parsed as a pandas timedelta and the
                                  expansion happens after that time has passed
                                  without an improvement  [default: 32]
      --expansions-limit INTEGER  when the --stale-limit has been reached, continue
                                  the search with random saddle connections that are
                                  twice as long as the ones used previously; repeat
                                  this doubling process that many times; once the
                                  limit has been reached, the search continues
                                  indefinitely  [default: <class 'int'>]
      --deform-limit TEXT         if set, deform the input surface after finding
                                  that many flow decompositions with cylinders
                                  without an increase in dimension; if not an
                                  integer, then this is parsed as a pandas timedelta
                                  and we deform after that time has passed without
                                  an improvement
      --cache-only                Do not perform any computation. Only query the
                                  cache.
      --help                      Show this message and exit.

Verify that this goal works in a non-survey run::

    >>> invoke(worker, "ngon", "-a", "1", "-a", "2", "-a", "4", "orbit-closure")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [OrbitClosure] ...
    [OrbitClosure] GL(2,R)-orbit closure of dimension at least 7 in H_3(3, 1) (ambient dimension 7) (dimension: 7) (dimension_upper_bound: 7) (directions: 8) (directions_with_cylinders: 8) (dense: True)

TESTS:

Verify that we can determine that some small surfaces have dense orbit closure::

    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> from flatsurvey.survey import survey
    >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Json
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

    >>> with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    ...     tmpdir = Path(tmpdir)
    ...     invoke(survey, "--debug", "--quiet", "ngons", "--count=4", "--vertices=3", "orbit-closure", "json", "--prefix", tmpdir)
    ...     cache = Cache(Cache.load([tmpdir]))

    >>> cached = cache.get("orbit-closure")
    >>> len(cached)
    4
    >>> cached.dense
    True

Verify that some small surfaces from the literature do not have dense orbit
closure::

    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> from flatsurvey.survey import survey
    >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Json
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

    >>> with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    ...     tmpdir = Path(tmpdir)
    ...     invoke(survey, "--debug", "--quiet", "ngons", "--literature=only", "--count=4", "--vertices=3", "orbit-closure", "--limit=128", "--deform-limit=20", "json", "--prefix", tmpdir)
    ...     cache = Cache(Cache.load([tmpdir]))

    >>> cached = cache.get("orbit-closure")
    >>> cached = cached.filter(lambda row: row.dimension_upper_bound != 2)
    >>> len(cached)
    2
    >>> cached.dense is None
    True

Verify that this also works if we set a runtime limit instead of an explicit
limit::

    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> from flatsurvey.survey import survey
    >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Json
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

    >>> with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    ...     tmpdir = Path(tmpdir)
    ...     invoke(survey, "--debug", "--time-limit=00:00:10", "--quiet", "ngons", "--literature=only", "--count=4", "--vertices=3", "orbit-closure", "--deform-limit=20", "json", "--prefix", tmpdir)
    ...     cache = Cache(Cache.load([tmpdir]))

    >>> cached = cache.get("orbit-closure")
    >>> cached = cached.filter(lambda row: row.dimension_upper_bound != 2)
    >>> cached.dense is None
    True

            Heuristically, it's sometimes helpful to skip over a range of saddle
            connections and continue with saddle connections that are much larger
            to find cylinders that can contribute again to the orbit closure
            computation.

            Also, we initially iterate over saddle connections by length,, i.e.,

            the system; there are lots of cylinders but the dimension doesn't
            increase anymore.

            On such surfaces, but heuristically also in some other cases, it
            can be beneficial to deform away from the problematic surface a
            little bit and restart the orbit closure search there.

            The downside of such a deformation is that it tends to lead to
            substantial coefficient bloat and therefore slows down all the
