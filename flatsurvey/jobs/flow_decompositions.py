r"""
Computes flow decompositions of a flat triangulation into cylinders and minimal components.

Usually you do not need to interact with this module directly. Flow
decompositions are created by the bits of the computation that need them on
demand.

However, you can still change some of the behaviour of this module through the
`flow-decompositions` command, e.g., to set a different `--limit` for the
number of Zorich induction steps:

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "flow-decompositions", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker flow-decompositions [OPTIONS]
      Turns directions coming from saddle connections into flow decompositions.
    Options:
      --limit INTEGER  Zorich induction steps to perform before giving up  [default: 256]
      --help           Show this message and exit.
