r"""
Determines whether a surface decomposes completely into cylinders in all directions.

Naturally, this can only be decided partially, i.e., we can say, "no",
there is some direction with a minimal component but we can never say "yes",
_all_ directions are cylinder periodic.

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "completely-cylinder-periodic", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker completely-cylinder-periodic [OPTIONS]
      Determines whether for all directions given by saddle connections, the
      decomposition of the surface is completely cylinder periodic, i.e., the
      decomposition consists only of cylinders.
    Options:
      --limit INTEGER  stop search after having looked at that many flow
                       decompositions  [default: no limit]
      --cache-only     Do not perform any computation. Only query the cache.
      --help           Show this message and exit.
