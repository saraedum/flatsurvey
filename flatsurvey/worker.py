r"""
Entrypoint for the survey worker to solve a single work package.

Invoke this providing a source and some goals, e.g., to compute the orbit
closure of a quadrilateral:
```
flatsurvey-worker ngon -a 1 -a 2 -a 3 -a 4 orbit-closure
```

TESTS::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> invoke(worker) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
      Explore a surface.
    Options:
      --debug
      --mem-limit TEXT   Gracefully stop the worker's current task when the memory
                         consumption exceeds this amount
      --time-limit TEXT  Gracefully stop the worker's current task when the wall
                         time elapsed exceeds this amount
      -v, --verbose      Enable verbose message, repeat for debug message.
      --help             Show this message and exit.
    Cache:
      local-cache  A readonly cache of previous results, read from local JSON...
      pickles      Provide pickle files as referenced in the caches.
