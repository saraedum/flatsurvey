Wraps several reporters to report on progress and results.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "report", "--help") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker report [OPTIONS]
      Generic reporting of results.
      A simple wrapper of several ``reporters`` that dispatches reporting.
    Options:
      --ignore TEXT  [default: flow-decompositions, saddle-connections, saddle-
                     connection-orientations]
      --help         Show this message and exit.

    >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon, Surface

    >>> from flatsurvey.reporting import Log
    >>> log = Log({Surface: surface}, output="-")
    >>> report = Report([log])
    >>> report.log(surface, "Hello World")
    [Ngon([1, 1, 1])] [Ngon] Hello World
