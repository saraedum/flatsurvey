r"""
Access cached results from previous runs.

Currently, the only cache we support is a plain-text database stored in .json
files and some accompanying Python pickles. It would be fairly trivial to
change that and allow for other similar systems as well (and we at some point
supported a GraphQL backend but it turned out to be impractical.)

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.worker import worker
    >>> invoke(worker, "local-cache", "--help")  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: worker local-cache [OPTIONS]
      A readonly cache of previous results, read from local JSON files.
    Options:
      -j, --json PATH    JSON files to read cached data from or a directory to read
                         recursively
      -p, --pickles DIR  directory of pickle files to resolve references in JSON
                         files
      --help             Show this message and exit.

    A readonly cache of previous results, read from local JSON files.

    INPUT:

    - ``cache`` -- a dict or ``None`` (default: ``None``); the underlying data
      in the cache, typically parsed from JSON files. This is a dictionary from
      strings, the sections of the cache such as ``"orbit_closure"`` to a list
      of results in that section. If ``None``, the cache is empty.

    - ``pickles`` -- a :class:`Pickles`` object or ``None`` (default:
      ``None``); a source of serialized data. Each entry in ``cache`` may for
      space reasons only hold limited information about an object and defer to
      a pickle under a ``"pickle"`` key. E.g., when storing the unfolding of a
      triangle, we might only hold the angles as a triple of integers and refer
      to a pickle which holds the actual unfolding for more complex queries to
      the surface. If ``None``, then pickles referenced in ``cache`` cannot be
      resolved.

        EXAMPLES:

        Cached results are automatically requested by a goal with
        :meth:`Goal._consume_cache` which calls this method.

        However, the cache can also be queried manually. Let's suppose that we
        have a cache from previous runs::

            >>> cache = { "orbit-closure": [
            ...     { "dense": None, "surface": {"type": "Ngon", "angles": [3, 4, 13], "pickle": "hash-0-of-a-3413"}, "pickle": "hash-0-of-an-orbit-closure"},
            ...     { "dense": None, "surface": {"type": "Ngon", "angles": [3, 4, 13], "pickle": "hash-1-of-a-3413"}, "pickle": "hash-1-of-an-orbit-closure"},
            ...     { "surface": {"type": "Ngon", "angles": [1, 2, 13], "pickle": "hash-0-of-a-1213"}, "pickle": "hash-2-of-an-orbit-closure"},
            ...     { "dense": True, "surface": {"type": "Ngon", "angles": [1, 2, 13], "pickle": "hash-1-of-a-1213"}, "pickle": "hash-3-of-an-orbit-closure"},
            ...     { "dense": True, "surface": {"type": "Ngon", "angles": [1, 2, 11], "pickle": "hash-0-of-a-1211"}, "pickle": "hash-4-of-an-orbit-closure"},
            ... ]}

        We provide some pickles for the sake of showcasing the features of the
        cache. Usually, these pickles are loaded from a directory on the
        filesystem and not injected statically like this::

            >>> from pickle import dumps
            >>> from flatsurvey.cache import Pickles
            >>> from flatsurvey.cache.pickles import StaticPickleProvider
            >>> pickles = Pickles([
            ...     StaticPickleProvider(dumps({"dense": True}), digest="hash-2-of-an-orbit-closure"),
            ... ])

            >>> cache = Cache(cache=cache, pickles=pickles)

        Then we can query all cached results for a goal::

            >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
            >>> cache.get(OrbitClosure)
            5 cached results

        We can filter the results further::

            >>> len(cache.get(OrbitClosure).filter(lambda entry: entry.dense is not True))
            2

        Or, if we only want results for a specific surface (the ``cache=cache``
        parameter is optional but speeds up searches a lot)::

            >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
            >>> surface = Ngon((1, 2, 4))
            >>> cache.get(OrbitClosure).filter(surface.cache_predicate(exact=False, cache=cache))
            0 cached results
            >>> surface = Ngon((3, 4, 13))
            >>> cache.get(OrbitClosure).filter(surface.cache_predicate(exact=False, cache=cache))
            2 cached results

        The above returns the results for any ngon with such angles. To only
        accept results for surfaces that are exactly the same, we can use the
        ``exact`` keyword; however this is not implemented yet::

            >>> cache.get(OrbitClosure).filter(surface.cache_predicate(exact=True))
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: exact filtering is not supported yet

        We can also only look at results for surfaces with certain properties::

            >>> cache.get(OrbitClosure).filter(lambda entry: entry.dense is not True)
            2 cached results

        Note that the above operation could be expensive because it needs to
        restore the pickle of the orbit closure where "dense" was not included
        in the cache. Instead, we can tell the cache to ignore pickles for
        "dense" and assume a default value instead::

            >>> with cache.defaults({"dense": None}):
            ...     with cache.sources("CACHE", "DEFAULTS"):
            ...         cache.get(OrbitClosure).filter(lambda entry: entry.dense is not True)
