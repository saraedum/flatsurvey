r"""
Aggregate cache files.

Combines JSON files that are produced by the
:class:`flatsurvey.reporting.json.Json` reporter into files grouped by subject,
i.e., type of result.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> from flatsurvey.cache.maintenance import cli
    >>> invoke(cli, "join", "--help")  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: cli join [OPTIONS] [JSONS]...
      Aggregates JSON files into one file for each type of result.
    Options:
      --outdir PATH  a directory to write the output files to  [required]
      --help         Show this message and exit.
