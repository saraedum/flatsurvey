Utilities to create the graph of objects that are performing a survey.

.. NOTE::

    This is essentially a scaled down dependency-injection framework.
    Dependency-injection is not really a thing in the Python world. Initially,
    we were using pinject but it's discontinued and it was also even more
    confusing to work with so we rolled our own.

.. NOTE::

    The principal feature we want here from the dependency injection is that it
    lets us optionally configure aspects of the object graph (say change the
    way we search for saddle connections or just stick with the defaults).

EXAMPLES:

The fundamental object here is the :class:`Bindings`. It holds the rules to
produce the object graph to run a survey of surfaces or a survey on a single
surface. Basically, a bindings can hold for each type (or string key) a rule on
how to produce it::

    >>> from flatsurvey.pipeline import Bindings
    >>> bindings = Bindings()

The easiest rules are just constants::

    >>> class Surface():
    ...     def __repr__(self): return "surface"

    >>> bindings.define(Surface, Surface())

Whenever somebody needs a Surface, we answer with this constant::

    >>> bindings.get(Surface)
    surface

The binding values can also be types, as long as they have a static
``create`` method::

    >>> class SaddleConnections:
    ...     def __init__(self, surface):
    ...         self._surface = surface
    ...
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     def create(bindings): return SaddleConnections(bindings.get(Surface))

    >>> bindings.define("sc", SaddleConnections)

    >>> bindings.get("sc")._surface
    surface

Note that the constant is cached, you get the identical object every single
time (in dependency injection lingo, all objects have singleton lifetime.)::

    >>> bindings.get("sc") is bindings.get("sc")
    True

When asking for a type that has not been registered with ``define``, its
``create`` is also called automatically::

    >>> bindings.get(SaddleConnections)._surface
    surface

We cannot redefine names that have been requested already::

    >>> bindings.define(SaddleConnections, SaddleConnections("..."))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: cannot redefine ...

However, we can explicitly "forget" values and bindings for a key (this feature
has no correspondence in classic dependency injection and is just a hack that
is convenient for our purposes.)::

    >>> bindings.forget(SaddleConnections)
    >>> bindings.define(SaddleConnections, SaddleConnections("..."))

    >>> bindings.get(SaddleConnections)._surface
    '...'

Note that this forgetting is not trying to be smart in any way. Dependent
objects are still present and the forget does not affect them.

We can also only define a variable in a certain scope::

    >>> class OrbitClosure:
    ...     def __init__(self, sc, ambient):
    ...         self._sc = sc
    ...         self._ambient = ambient
    ...
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     def create(bindings):
    ...         with bindings.scope(OrbitClosure) as scoped:
    ...             return OrbitClosure(bindings.get(SaddleConnections), scoped.get("ambient"))
    ...

    >>> with bindings.scope(OrbitClosure) as scoped:
    ...     scoped.define("ambient", "H_6(5^2, 0^2)")

    >>> bindings.get(OrbitClosure)._ambient
    'H_6(5^2, 0^2)'

Oftentimes, you want to incrementally register a list of things under one key,
say the goals of a survey::

    >>> bindings.append(list["Goal"], OrbitClosure)
    >>> bindings.append(list["Goal"], "something else")

    >>> bindings.get(list["Goal"])
    (<flatsurvey.pipeline.bindings.OrbitClosure object at 0x...>, 'something else')
