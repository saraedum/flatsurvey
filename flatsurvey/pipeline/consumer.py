class Consumer(Goal):
    r"""
    In the pipeline graph of jobs, anything that an edge points to is a
    Consumer. So consumers take in intermediate results that come out of a
    Producer, e.g., OrbitClosure consumes the decompositions that come out of
    FlowDecompositions. FlowDecompositions is itself a Consumer (and a
    Producer) which consumes directions of saddle connections.

    EXAMPLES::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import SaddleConnectionOrientations, SaddleConnections
        >>> surface = Ngon((1, 1, 1))
        >>> connections = SaddleConnections(surface=surface)
        >>> isinstance(connections, Consumer)
        False
        >>> orientations = SaddleConnectionOrientations(saddle_connections=connections)
        >>> isinstance(orientations, Consumer)
        True

    Each consumer registers to one (or several) ``producers``. Whenever these
    produces generate something new, the consumers ``consume`` method is
    called::

        >>> orientations._producers
        [saddle-connections]

    .. NOTE:

        While technically all consumers are a :class:`Goal` only the ones that
        make sense as the actual "goal" of a survey register themselves as
        goals in their ``click``.

        The ``cost`` is the amount of time it took to generate that product;
        this can be used to determine whether things should be cached for
        example.
