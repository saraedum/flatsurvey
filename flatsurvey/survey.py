r"""
Entrypoint to run surveys.

Typically, you invoke this providing some sources and some goals, e.g., to
compute the orbit closure of all quadrilaterals:
```
flatsurvey ngons --vertices 4 orbit-closure
```

TESTS::

    >>> from flatsurvey.test.cli import invoke
    >>> invoke(survey)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Usage: survey [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
      Run a survey on the `objects` until all the `goals` are reached.
    Options:
      --debug
      --queue INTEGER   Jobs to prepare in the background for scheduling. [default:
                        3 × cores]
      -v, --verbose     Enable verbose message, repeat for debug message.
      --quiet           Silence all terminal output
      --scheduler TEXT  Path to a dask scheduler file
      --help            Show this message and exit.
    Cache:
      local-cache  A readonly cache of previous results, read from local JSON...
      pickles      Provide pickle files as referenced in the caches.
    Goals:
      completely-cylinder-periodic  Determines whether for all directions given...
      cylinder-periodic-direction   Determines whether there is a direction for...
      orbit-closure                 Determines the GL₂(R) orbit closure of...
      undetermined-iets             Tracks undetermined Interval Exchange...
    Intermediates:
      flow-decompositions             Turns directions coming from saddle...
      saddle-connection-orientations  Orientations of saddle connections on the...
      saddle-connections              Saddle connections on the surface.
    Reports:
      json    Writes results in JSON format.
      log     Writes progress and results as an unstructured log file.
      report  Generic reporting of results.
    Surfaces:
      ngons  The translation surfaces that come from unfolding n-gons.

We compute orbit closures of a few triangles::

    >>> invoke(survey, "orbit-closure", "ngons", "--vertices", "3", "--count", "3")
