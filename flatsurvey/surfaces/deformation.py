Deformations of surfaces

During an orbit closure search, it might be necessary to replace a given
surface with a deformation in the orbit closure to be able to determine the
full dimension of the orbit closure of the original surface.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon, Deformation
    >>> from flatsurf.geometry.pyflatsurf_conversion import from_pyflatsurf
    >>> from flatsurf import GL2ROrbitClosure

    >>> S = Ngon((1, 1, 1))

    >>> O = GL2ROrbitClosure(S.surface())

    >>> delta = [O.V2(v, 0).vector for v in O.lift(O.tangent_space_basis()[0])]
    >>> deformation = from_pyflatsurf((O._surface + delta).surface())

    >>> T = Deformation(deformation, S)
    >>> T
    Deformation of Ngon([1, 1, 1])

class Deformation(Surface):
    r"""
    A surface that is considered a "deformed" version of an ``old`` original
    surface.

    Currently, we use this to move away from pathological surfaces in the orbit
    closure where our approach would never be able to determine the full
    dimension of the orbit closure.

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon, Deformation
        >>> from flatsurf.geometry.pyflatsurf_conversion import from_pyflatsurf
        >>> from flatsurf import GL2ROrbitClosure

        >>> delta = [O.V2(v, 0).vector for v in O.lift(O.tangent_space_basis()[0])]
        >>> deformation = from_pyflatsurf((O._surface + delta).surface())

        >>> T = Deformation(deformation, S)
        >>> T
        Deformation of Ngon([1, 1, 1])
