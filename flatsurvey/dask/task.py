Implementation of a job that runs on a dask client.

When our main driver communicates with the dask scheduler, there are some
limitations what kind of objects we can safely and efficiently put on the queue
of jobs to process. A :class:`Task` encodes such a job which is executed by
the :class:`flatsurvey.dask.Runner`.

We load this module into the actual dask workers with ``--preload
flatsurvey.dask.worker``.

EXAMPLES:

This is a support module for the :mod:`flatsurvey.dask.scheduler` it is not
meant to be used in isolation. Nevertheless, for the sake of testing, we can
spin up a dask client and have it run a task from this module::

    >>> from dask.distributed import Client
    >>> from flatsurvey.dask import SchedulerCancellationToken

    >>> client = Client(processes=False, nthreads=1, preload="flatsurvey.dask.worker")
    >>> token = SchedulerCancellationToken(client)

    >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon, Surface
    >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
    >>> from flatsurvey.pipeline import Bindings, Goal

    >>> survey = Bindings()
    >>> survey.append(list[Goal], OrbitClosure)

    >>> bindings1 = survey.clone()
    >>> bindings1.define(Surface, Ngon(angles=[1, 1, 1]))

    >>> bindings2 = survey.clone()
    >>> bindings2.define(Surface, Ngon(angles=[1, 1, 2]))

    >>> tasks = [Task(bindings=bindings1), Task(bindings=bindings2)]
    >>> tasks
    [Task(…), Task(…)]

    >>> futures = [client.submit(task, token.worker_token) for task in tasks]
    >>> results = [future.result() for future in futures]

Note that the futures have no actual result, the result is usually written to
some log file by a reporter instead::

    >>> results
    [None, None]

    >>> client.shutdown()

.. NOTE::

    A lot is complicated here by SageMath (and its dependencies) being very
    picky about how things are set up when running in forked processes.

    If we import sage.all in a worker, we get an exception from cysignals:
    "signal only works in main thread of the main interpreter". The dask worker
    runs workloads in a separate thread but SageMath does not like to get
    imported on a non-main thread.

    We could just preload sage.all into the dask worker (``--preload``.)
    However, SageMath still does not like to do things in a threaded
    environment and typically cypari2 segfaults in such a setup.

    To work around this, we fork from the worker thread. Since importing
    sage.all is very costly, we use a forkserver and ``set_forkserver_preload``
    sage.all once. We use one thread per core in the dask worker which then
    translates to one forked process per core. (We further instruct SageMath to
    work in a non-parallel mode via ``MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1``.)

    We cannot use a dask nanny with our workers since the nanny spawns the
    worker as a daemon, and a daemon cannot easily have children in Python (see
    https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2011-March/600152.html.) So
    we must start our workers with ``--no-nanny``.

    Finally, this approach also works around memory leaks. SageMath tends to
    leak memory over time. Starting the worker from scratch with every single
    computation has a bit of a performance impact but usually there is not that
    much overlap between computations anyway.

class Task:
    r"""
    A task to execute on a dask worker.

    Note that the inputs are not stored directly in the ``__dict__`` of this
    object. Instead, we store a serialization of these objects. This is crucial
    to make SageMath and dask cooperate. The first thing that a dask worker
    does is to fork, so there is a nanny process and an actual worker doing the
    work. However, SageMath does not like to be in a process that was forked in
    that way. Therefore, we shouldn't unpickle these objects because that
    triggers the loading of SageMath. Also, even without the nanny, these
    objects tend to cause memory leaks (due to UniqueRepresentation for
    example.) Therefore, we only unpickle objects in a fresh process that then
    does the actual processing, so we start with a clean SageMath session for
    every task.

    INPUT:

    - ``bindings`` -- the bindings from which we restore the goals that this task needs to resolve

    - ``repr`` -- a custom representation of this task to help debugging

    EXAMPLES:

    We define a task to be executed on the worker::

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon, Surface
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
        >>> from flatsurvey.pipeline import Bindings, Goal

        >>> bindings = Bindings()
        >>> bindings.define(Surface, Ngon(angles=[1, 1, 1]))
        >>> bindings.append(list[Goal], OrbitClosure)

        >>> task = Task(bindings=bindings)
        >>> task
        Task(…)

    Normally, the task is going to be serialized, sent to a worker,
    deserialized, and then gets called on the worker. Here we call it directly
    for demonstration purposes (the ``client`` here is essentially unused
    therefore but required by the underlying machinery)::

        >>> from dask.distributed import Client
        >>> from flatsurvey.dask import SchedulerCancellationToken

        >>> client = Client(processes=False, nthreads=1, preload="flatsurvey.dask.worker")
        >>> token = SchedulerCancellationToken(client)

        >>> task(token.worker_token)

    Calling a task like this makes sure that the necessary machinery is set up
    on the worker, i.e., a :class:`Runner` gets created which forks off
    the actual execution process, sets up message queues, …; eventually, the
    task's :meth:`run` is executed and the result of that call is reported
    back (in this case, only an exception would be reported; since this
    particular task returns ``None``.)

        >>> client.shutdown()

    """

    # below.

        Execute this task in the current worker and return the result.

        This is the callable that is submitted via ``client.submit`` by the scheduler.

        INPUT:

        - ``token`` -- the ``id`` of the :class:`SchedulerCancellationToken` of
          the running dask scheduler

            >>> bindings.append(list[Goal], OrbitClosure)

            >>> task = Task(bindings=bindings)

        Normally, this task would be submitted to a remote worker via
        ``client.submit``  which then calls it; for demonstration purposes we
        call it directly (the ``client`` here is essentially unused therefore
        but required by the underlying machinery)::

            >>> task(token.worker_token)

        Any exceptions that occur during the computation (here we forgot to set
        a required parameter) are rethrown as generic ``RunnerException``::

            >>> task = Task(bindings=bindings)

        We bake the description of this task in during construction since we do
        not want to unpickle any of the ``_dump`` to determine the repr of this
        object when printing status messages.
