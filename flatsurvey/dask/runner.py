class Runner:
    r"""
    Executes a :class:`Task` in this worker.

    This works around limitations that arise when combining dask and SageMath,
    namely, that we cannot use SageMath in a normal nanny-observer threaded
    dask worker. See :mod:`flatsurvey.dask.task` for details.

    Instances of this are created by :meth:`Task.__call__`. There should be
    no use case to instantiate this otherwise.

    EXAMPLES:

    We create a task that can be executed on a runner::

        >>> from dask.distributed import Client
        >>> from flatsurvey.dask import SchedulerCancellationToken

        >>> client = Client(processes=False, nthreads=1, preload="flatsurvey.dask.worker")
        >>> token = SchedulerCancellationToken(client)

        >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Ngon, Surface
        >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
        >>> from flatsurvey.pipeline import Bindings, Goal

        >>> bindings = Bindings()
        >>> bindings.define(Surface, Ngon(angles=[1, 1, 1]))
        >>> bindings.append(list[Goal], OrbitClosure)

        >>> task = Task(bindings=bindings)

    Normally, one would now submit this task to the dask ``client`` which
    executes :meth:`run`. For the sake of documentation, we create a runner
    manually and execute the task there. (The ``client`` created earlier is not
    used here at all, it's just needed to make the underlying machinery
    happy.)::

        >>> runner = Runner(task, token.worker_token)
        >>> runner.run()

        >>> client.shutdown()

    """

    def __init__(self, task: Task, token: WorkerCancellationToken):
        self._task = task
        self._token = token

        # We use a pipe to signal that the computation is complete. The
        # advantage over a queue is that if the worker process crashes, we
        # receive an EOF when trying to read from it.
        self._result_receiver, self._result_sender = forkserver.Pipe(duplex=False)

        # We use a pipe to signal to the worker process that we are still
        # waiting for the computation. A thread in the worker process tries to
        # read from the pipe and crashes when the other side closes it.
        self._shutdown_receiver, self._shutdown_sender = forkserver.Pipe(duplex=False)

        # Since a pipe is limited to 32MB, we use an actual queue to
        # communicate the result back. (Then again, we usually do not send any
        # non-trivial data back but store survey results on a shared disk
        # directly from the worker.)

        r"""
        Fork a process and run the registered task in that process.

        EXAMPLES:

        We create a task that can be executed on a runner::

            >>> from dask.distributed import Client
            >>> from flatsurvey.dask import SchedulerCancellationToken

            >>> client = Client(processes=False, nthreads=1, preload="flatsurvey.dask.worker")

            >>> bindings.append(list[Goal], OrbitClosure)

            >>> task = Task(bindings=bindings)

        We execute the task::

            >>> runner = Runner(task, token.worker_token)
            >>> runner.run()

        When the task throws an exception it is propagated from the forked
        process. However, it is wrapped as a :class:`RunnerException` which
        holds the original exception only textually since unpickling the
        exception might not be possible::

            >>> bindings = Bindings()
            >>> bindings.append(list[Goal], OrbitClosure)

            >>> task = Task(bindings=bindings)

            >>> runner = Runner(task, token.worker_token)
