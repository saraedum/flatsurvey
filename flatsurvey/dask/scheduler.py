r"""
Runs a survey with dask on the local machine or in a cluster.

This implements a (somewhat unnecessary) wrapper for the dask API.

EXAMPLES:

We compute the orbit closure of the (1,1,1) and the (1,1,2) triangles::
    
    >>> from flatsurvey.pipeline import Bindings, Goal
    >>> survey = Bindings()

    >>> from flatsurvey.surfaces import Surface, Ngons
    >>> ngons = Ngons(vertices=3, length="e-antic", min=0, limit=None, count=2, literature='include', family=None, filter=None)
    >>> survey.survey(Surface, ngons)

    >>> from flatsurvey.jobs import OrbitClosure
    >>> survey.append(Goal, OrbitClosure)

    >>> scheduler = Scheduler(survey_bindings=survey.survey_bindings)

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(scheduler.start())
    on ...: all jobs have been scheduled
    waiting for jobs to finish ...

class Scheduler:
    r"""
    A scheduler that splits a survey into tasks that are sent out to workers
    via the dask protocol.

    INPUT::

    - ``survey_bindings`` -- an iterator of :class:`Bindings` that lists which
      computations should be performed by this survey, usually created with
      :meth:`Bindings.survey_bindings`.

    - ``scheduler`` -- a dask scheduler file to connect to; if not given (the
      default) then a dedicated dask scheduler is launched

    - ``queue_limit`` -- the number of processes to initially submit into the
      dask scheduler before we wait for workers to finish (default: thrice the
      number of worker threads provided by the dask scheduler)

    ALGORITHM:

    We'll have lots of jobs, (e.g., surfaces,) that we want to run with one
    scheduler usually. Often even an infinite family. So we cannot submit all
    the jobs into the dask job queue and wait for them to complete.

    Instead, we try to keep a good amount of a "backlog" in the queue so that
    our workers never run out of things to do. Whenever a worker finishes a
    job, we try to keep the queue equally full by finding a new job to submit
    into the queue (this might take a while since we might be able to obtain
    the results for a lot of configurations from our caches and won't submit
    them into the queue therefore.)

        >>> Scheduler(survey_bindings=[])
        Scheduler(…)

        r"""
        Replace the handler for the SIGINT signal while this context is active
        so that pressing Ctrl-C aborts the survey.

        .. NOTE:

            The signal handling that SageMath (or rather cysignals) installs
            for the SIGINT (i.e., Ctrl-C) signal does not play well in the
            (async?) dask world. What exactly happens is unclear but somehow
            when our ``_consume()`` entered ``dask.distributed.wait()`` and
            then we press Ctrl-C, a SIGABRT is raised (or at least it says
            "Aborted!" in the terminal) and then this asynchronous execution
            thread basically disappears. The program eventually exits but no
            exception is raised, and no finally blocks are executed here.

            Whatever is going on exactly, we don't want any special handling of
            Ctrl-C in the scheduling process. When Ctrl-C is pressed while
            SageMath is doing something (say doing a bit of arithmetic to
            figure out what's the next surface to survey) that's usually very
            fast and we cannot interrupt it safely anyway. So we do not rely on
            the KeyboardInterrupt at all here but just handle SIGINT ourselves
            to cancel/abort the survey.

        EXAMPLES::

            >>> scheduler = Scheduler(survey_bindings=[])

            >>> import os, signal
